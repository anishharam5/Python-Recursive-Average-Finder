# Python-Recursive-Average-Finder
A python based average calculator which can handle single number with sequence of digits, or an tuple with nested lists and tuples and a regulate tuple with multiple digits

# Nested Average Calculator

This Python script calculates the average of a sequence of numbers, including nested lists and tuples. It recursively processes the input to find all integers and calculates their average.

## Usage

Run the `avg.py` script and provide the sequence of numbers as arguments.

Example:

```bash
python avg.py 8 7 6 5 5 8 [12, 34, 56] (123, 456) [[1, 2, 3], (4, 5, 6)] ((7, 8, 9), (10, 11, 12))
